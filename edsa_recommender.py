        Finding products that match the user's historical tastes takes into account their earlier preferences. 
        One advantage of Content-based filtering is that the model does not need any data about other users, since the recommendations are specific to this user. 
        This makes it easier to scale to a large number of users. The model can capture the specific interests of a user, and can recommend niche items that very few other users are interested in.

        It will give the user access to a greater variety of content and base recommendations on how similar their interests are.
        Due to its widespread use and comparatively simple operation, it also makes straightforward maintenance 
        and ongoing customization possible. Additionally, it performs better than the Content Based Filter because it uses less processing power.

The primary advantage of collaborative filtering is that users can get broader exposure to many different movies , which creates possibilities to encourage them towards continual usage of the platform. 
        Collaborative filtering gives suggestions because most of the unknown buyers have a similar taste to you. Still, in Content-based, you will get the recommendations of movies based on their features. In contrast to Collaborative filtering, new new movies are suggested without any specifications to the users.
        The collaborative filtering model can help users discover new interests and although the ML system might not know the users interest in a given movie, the model might still recommend it because similar users are interested in that movie. 
        On the other hand, A Content-based model can only make recommendations based on the existing interests of the user and the model hence only has limited ability to expand on the users existing interests.
